    "# 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans:> Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update. ... A function call is what moves the program execution into the function, and the function call evaluates to the function's return value.\n"

    "Ans:> A function call means invoking or calling that function. Unless a function is called there is no use of that function. ... So the difference between the function and function call is, A function is procedure to achieve a particular result while function call is using this function to achive that task.\n"

    "Ans:> There's only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. When you use an unqualified name inside a function, Python searches three scopes—the local (L), then the global (G), and then the built-in (B)—and stops at the first place the name is found\n"

    "Ans:> A return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and “returns” the result (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned\n"

If no return statement appears in a function definition, control automatically returns to the calling function after the last statement of the called function is executed. In this case, the return value of the called function is undefined.\n"

    "Ans:> Prevents program from crashing if an error occurs. If an error occurs in a program, we don't want the program to unexpectedly crash on the user. Instead, error handling can be used to notify the user of why the error occurred and gracefully exit the process that caused the error.\n"
